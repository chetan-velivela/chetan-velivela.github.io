### CASHIER.VISION

  Cashier.Vision has been conceived as a way to revamp the mundane checkout process in retail stores and is aimed to give the customer the perfect seamless checkout process which wraps up the perfect shopping experience. 

  Our in house designed and developed *Cashier.Vision ARC* module automatically recognizes the items being placed on a constanlty moving checkout belt system and bills it up as the items are loaded. This completely cuts out the arduous task of waiting in line while the cashier struggles with a bar code to scan the items on the belt.
